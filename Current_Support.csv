2025-2030,Evidence-based optimization of treatment timing in the craniofacial complex,NIH NIDCR,"Richard Sherwood (Co-PI), Kevin Middleton (Co-PI), Dana Duren (Co-I), Heesoo Oh (Co-PI; U Pacific), Kieran McNulty (Co-I, U Minnesota, Manish Valiathan (Co-PI; Case Western Reserve U).","This project addresses an issue of central importance to treatment of craniofacial, orthodontic, and maxillofacial disorders by creating new 3D standards of craniofacial growth based on a racially diverse sample of children from five to twenty-five years of age. Once established, these standards will provide individualized predictions of patient growth potential and the timing of growth parameters for craniofacial traits. The results will improve the ability of clinicians to determine the optimal timing and duration of treatment, thus optimizing treatment outcomes for millions of U.S. children (\$3,395,905)"
