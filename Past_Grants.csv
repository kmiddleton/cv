2022-2023,Biomechanics of Grasping in Primates,Leakey Foundation,"Carol Ward, Casey Holliday, and \textbf{Kevin Middleton} (co-PI) \\ \$25,000","This project will use contrast-enhanced µCT imagery combined with machine learning and computational biology to visualize, quantify, and compare the musculoskeletal anatomy and biomechanical potential associated with the hands and feet of humans and our closest living relatives, chimpanzees and gorillas, in 3D and in situ for the first time. This will provide the first-ever 3D digital archives of the intact soft tissue anatomy of chimpanzee, gorilla and human hands and feet. (\$24,995)"
2021--2023,Maturation-based prediction of craniofacial growth,University of Missouri TRIUMPH,RJ Sherwood and D Duren (Multiple PI) \\ \textbf{Kevin Middleton}: co-Investigator (5\% salary support),"This project leverages the considerable resources from the parent project to create Bayesian models of craniofacial growth timing and use machine learning approaches to accurately predict facial growth parameters. (\$100,000)"
2015--2022,R01 - Craniofacial Growth Prediction in Diﬀerent Facial Types,NIH NIDCR,RJ Sherwood and HS Oh (Multiple PI) \\ \textbf{Kevin Middleton} co-I (Lead data scientist; 10\% salary support),"We have identified landmarks on over 25,000 lateral cephalographs from 5,247 individuals age 0-27 years from eight growth studies. This research will 1) estimate population- and individual-level timing of pubertal growth and adult size for multiple craniofacial traits, 2) provide diagnostic reference charts for craniofacial measures, 3) develop prognostic tools to predict remaining growth/change and the timing of the pubertal growth spurt for craniofacial traits, 4) make these valuable resources available to clinicians and researchers via an easy-to-use free web-based application."
2019--2020,Administrative Supplement to \emph{Craniofacial Growth Prediction in Different Facial Types},NIH NIDCR,RJ Sherwood (PI) \\ \textbf{Kevin Middleton} co-I 10\% salary support,"This administrative supplement leveraged the considerable resources from the parent project to create Bayesian models of craniofacial growth timing and use machine learning approaches to accurately predict facial growth parameters.  (\$116,169)"
2017,Differential Gene Expression of Bone in Response to Experimental Loading Regimes,MU DNA Core Facility NextGen Sequencing Pilot Award,\textbf{Kevin Middleton} PI,"This award supported preliminary research into the differential expression of genes in bone: RNA sequencing and analysis of data.

We developed novel techniques for imaging muscle structure via contrast-enhanced micro-CT, new finite-element computational models for estimating cranial loads in extant and extinct animals, and visualization techniques for representing 3D data in two-dimensional space.

We used a long-term experiment of raising American alligators in varying levels of atmospheric oxygen for 24 months. We found that overall growth rates as well as skeletal morphology was largely unaltered by changes in available oxygen.
