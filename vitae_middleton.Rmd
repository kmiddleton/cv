# Research Interests

My research focuses on musculoskeletal physiology, form, and function in the contexts of animal locomotion, feeding, and vertebrate evolution. In my work, I integrate studies across multiple scales from micro-scale structural materials of bone to macro-scale whole bone morphology to evolutionary changes across vertebrate taxa and with comparisons to extinct organisms.

## Current Projects

- Evolution of the avian head: integrating cranial biomechanics, muscle modeling, and brain evolution to understand avian cranial kinesis
- Development of Bayesian and machine learning models for the prediction of craniofacial growth and form in humans
- Effects of exercise and genetic background on skeletal form, physiology, and biomechanics using high activity mice as a model organism
