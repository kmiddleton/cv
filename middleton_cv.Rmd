# Research Interests and Current Projects

My overall research focuses on form, physiology, and function of the skeletal and muscular systems in the contexts of growth, locomotion, feeding, and evolution. In my work, I integrate studies across multiple scales from micro-scale structural materials of bone to macro-scale whole bone and multi-element cranial morphology to evolutionary changes across taxa and with comparisons to extinct organisms.

## Development of Bayesian and machine learning models for the prediction of craniofacial growth in humans.

- For orthodontic and craniofacial interventions, estimation of the timing of peak growth and/or the amount of remaining growth is is important for planning treatment. We are seeking to estimate these quantities for a wide range of traits in two- and three-dimensional imaging.

## Evolution of the reptile head: integrating cranial biomechanics, muscle modeling, and brain evolution to understand cranial kinesis and diversity

- Computational modelling of cranial function has allowed us to estimate all the forces acting on the jaws and skull. We are developing techniques to apply contrast-enhanced imaging to refine muscle force estimates and generate a complete picture of head function.

## Effects of exercise and genetic background on skeletal form, physiology, and biomechanics using high activity mice as a model organism

- Although "exercise builds strong bones", genetics play a large part in bone's response to exercise. I have developed an animal model to investigate the relative roles of these two key determinants of skeletal form.
