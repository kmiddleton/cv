  abstract = {We examined the relationship between forelimb design and function
              across the 230-million-year history of theropod evolution.
              Forelimb disparity was assessed by plotting the relative
              contributions of the three main limb elements on a ternary
              diagram. Theropods were divided into five functional groups:
              predatory, reduced, flying, wing-propelled diving, and flighdess.
              Forelimbs which maintained their primitive function, predation,
              are similarly proportioned, but non-avian theropods with highly
              reduced forelimbs have relatively longer humeri. Despite the
              dramatically different forces imparted by the evolution of flight,
              forelimb proportions of basal birds are only slighdy different
              from those of their non-avian relatives. An increase in disparity
              accompanied the subsequent radiation of birds. Each transition to
              flightlessness has been accompanied by an increase in relative
              humeral length, which results from relatively short distal limb
              elements. We introduce theoretical predictions based on five
              biomechanical and developmental factors that may have influenced
              the evolution of theropod limb proportions.},
