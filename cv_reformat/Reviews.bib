  title       = "Challenges and advances in the study of pterosaur flight",

  abstract    = "Pterosaurs have fascinated scientists and nonscientists alike
                 for over 200 years, as one of the three known clades of
                 vertebrates to have evolved flapping flight. The smallest
                 pterosaurs were comparable in size to the smallest extant
                 birds and bats, but the largest pterosaurs were vastly larger
                 than any extant flier. This immense size range, coupled with
                 poor preservation and adaptations for flight unknown in extant
                 vertebrates, have made interpretations of pterosaur flight
                 problematic and often contentious. Here we review the
                 anatomical, evolutionary, and phylogenetic history of
                 pterosaurs, as well as the views, perspectives, and biases
                 regarding their interpretation. In recent years, three areas
                 of pterosaur biology have faced challenges and made advances:
                 structure of the wing membrane, function of the pteroid, body
                 size and mass estimates, as well as flight mechanics and
                 aerodynamics. Comparative anatomical and fossil study,
                 simulated bone loading, and aerodynamic modeling have all
                 proved successful in furthering our understanding of pterosaur
                 flight. We agree with previous authors that pterosaurs should
                 be studied as pterosaurs, a diverse but phylogenetically,
                 anatomically, and mechanically constrained clade that can
                 offer new insights into the diversity of vertebrate flight.",
