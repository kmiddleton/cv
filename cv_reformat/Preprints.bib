  abstract = "The nutritional conditions experienced by a population play a
              major role in shaping trait evolution in many taxa. Constraints
              exerted by nutrient limitation or nutrient imbalance can
              influence the maximal value that fitness components such as
              reproduction and lifespan attains, and organisms may shift how
              resources are allocated to different structures and functions in
              response to changes in nutrition. Whether the phenotypic changes
              associated with changes in nutrition represent an adaptive
              response is largely unknown, and whether the response of fitness
              components to diet even has the potential to evolve in response
              to selection is not generally known. In this study, we use an
              admixed multiparental population of Drosophila melanogaster
              reared in three different diet conditions to estimate
              quantitative genetic parameters for lifespan and fecundity. We
              develop a new image analysis technique for estimating fecundity,
              removing the need to hand count eggs and use this method to show
              there is significant genetic variation for fecundity in our
              population. Our results also show that lifespan has moderate to
              high heritabilities within diets, and genetic correlations for
              lifespan between diets that are less than one demonstrate a
              genotype by diet interaction. These findings demonstrate
              substantial standing genetic variation in our population that is
              comparable to natural populations and highlights the potential
              for adaptation to changing nutritional environments.",
