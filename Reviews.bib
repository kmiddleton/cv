  abstract     = {Pterosaurs have fascinated scientists and nonscientists alike
                  for over 200 years, as one of the three known clades of
                  vertebrates to have evolved flapping flight. The smallest
                  pterosaurs were comparable in size to the smallest extant
                  birds and bats, but the largest pterosaurs were vastly larger
                  than any extant flier. This immense size range, coupled with
                  poor preservation and adaptations for flight unknown in extant
                  vertebrates, have made interpretations of pterosaur flight
                  problematic and often contentious. Here we review the
                  anatomical, evolutionary, and phylogenetic history of
                  pterosaurs, as well as the views, perspectives, and biases
                  regarding their interpretation. In recent years, three areas
                  of pterosaur biology have faced challenges and made advances:
                  structure of the wing membrane, function of the pteroid, body
                  size and mass estimates, as well as flight mechanics and
                  aerodynamics. Comparative anatomical and fossil study,
                  simulated bone loading, and aerodynamic modeling have all
                  proved successful in furthering our understanding of pterosaur
                  flight. We agree with previous authors that pterosaurs should
                  be studied as pterosaurs, a diverse but phylogenetically,
                  anatomically, and mechanically constrained clade that can
                  offer new insights into the diversity of vertebrate flight.},
