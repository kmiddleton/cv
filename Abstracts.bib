  abstract     = {Sauropsid vertebrates (lepidosaurs, turtles, crocodilians and
                  birds) have evolved a diversity of head shapes and feeding
                  behaviors during their history. A key to understanding this
                  great radiation of reptiles is the physiology of the jaw
                  musculature which powers the feeding apparatus. However we
                  still know little about jaw muscle mechanics within lineages
                  of reptiles or how this complicated musculoskeletal system has
                  evolved to employ a variety of behaviors. New imaging and
                  computational methods are now enabling an extraordinary view
                  into the 3D anatomy and biomechanics of reptiles and other
                  vertebrates. Here we illustrate several approaches to
                  analyzing jaw muscle morphology and architecture using
                  contrast imaging, 3D fiber tracking, biomechanical analysis,
                  and data visualization methods that offer enormous potential
                  for exploring the anatomy, function and evolution of jaw
                  muscles. We first illustrate basic workflow of 3D jaw muscle
                  visualization, morphometrics and interpretation using
                  crocodilian jaw muscle anatomy. Second, we show how homologous
                  jaw muscle bellies evolve among lineages of different reptiles
                  and birds to elicit different functional demands. Third, we
                  show how the 3D architecture of hard-to-dissect, small, deep
                  protractor muscles correlate with different types of cranial
                  kinesis among a sample of lizards and birds. These new imaging
                  and analytical approaches offer incredible potential for the
                  quantification of soft tissue morphology like muscle
                  architecture and their applications to comparative
                  biomechanics, ecomorphology, and evolutionary biology should
                  prove remarkable.},

                  variation in hand morphology has been central to discussions
                  of the evolution of in hominoids, especially humans. Although
                  there is an extensive literature on bony morphology, muscle
                  size and strength, kinematics, and use of the hand, to date it
                  has not been possible to visualize and quantify the mechanics
                  of the of the hand in situ. This study compared the intrinsic
                  hand muscles of Homo sapiens and Pan troglodytes in 3D. Each
                  specimen was fixed, stained with Lugol's iodine, and microCT
                  scanned [<61 Âµm resolution]. Bones, muscles and the flexor
                  retinaculum were segmented using Avizo. Avizo Xfiber was used
                  to visualize and quantify fascicle orientation within muscles,
                  which permits quantification of both whole muscle and within
                  muscle fascicle orientations. Fascicle length, pennation
                  angles and muscle volume were used to calculate PCSA and
                  estimate force output of each muscle. Together, these data are
                  used to compare functional capability of muscles individually
                  and in aggregate. Data reveal differences in force-generating
                  capacity and force orientations of muscles, and with
                  finer-scale variation of within-muscle fascicle orientations.
                  The most significant differences were found in the adductor
                  pollicis and opponens pollicis, which are larger and more
                  transversely oriented in humans than in chimpanzees. Data also
                  reveal differences in other thenar and hypothenar muscles,
                  affecting the capacity to effect different grips. Our approach
                  and results highlight the importance of evaluating of the
                  musculoskeletal system of the hand in 3D which can then be
                  used to compare to bone form across hominoids.},

                  skeletal morphology are critical to interpretations of
                  vertebrate functional anatomy. In skeletal specimens, these
                  goals can be accomplished using in-silico models derived from
                  3D laser scan, photogrammetry, or computed tomography (CT)
                  data. Assessments of skeletal morphology in living subjects,
                  especially humans, are more challenging and are often either
                  cost-prohibitive (e.g., magnetic resonance) or expose subjects
                  to high doses of ionizing radiation (e.g., CT). Here, we
                  present a new, open-source method for assessing 3D skeletal
                  morphology using ultra-low dose biplanar radiographs. Biplanar
                  radiographs were obtained using an EOS Imaging System (EOS
                  Imaging, Inc., Paris, France). A custom-built calibration
                  frame with radiopaque markers was scanned using this system on
                  multiple days in multiple positions inside the scanning space.
                  We quantified the 3D coordinates of markers by placing
                  landmarks at the center of each marker in both
                  anterior-posterior and lateral radiographs. Landmark data for
                  each scan were collected independently by two observers to
                  determine inter-observer error. 3D coordinates of landmarks in
                  each scan differed by <1 mm between observers, suggesting
                  strong repeatability in assessing morphology of living
                  subjects. To assess distortion in EOS images, we constructed a
                  second calibration device, a flat plate with radiopaque
                  markers at the corners of three squares with 10 cm, 20 cm, and
                  30 cm sides, respectively, surrounding an origin point. The
                  calibration plate was scanned with the origin point at the
                  center of the scan area and the sides of the squares parallel
                  to the detectors. We identified distortion at the edges of EOS
                  images which could significantly impact measurements on
                  skeletal features near the margins of the scan area (i.e.,
                  hips, pelvis, lower limbs) and developed a method to
                  mathematically correct for resulting distortion in landmark
                  data. Finally, we demonstrate this method using measurements
                  of iliac blade and spinous process orientation in a sample of
                  living human participants. This method will be applicable to
                  studies of multiple human cohorts, including symptomatic and
                  asymptomatic groups, as well as to other biplanar radiograph
                  platforms and study organisms.},

  abstract     = {The divergent specializations of living archosaurs,
                  crocodilians and birds, represent two of the great
                  transformations in vertebrate evolution. Despite hailing from
                  common ancestor with a tall skull, braced palate and
                  relatively unspecialized jaw muscles, these two living clades
                  followed disparate paths in cranial biomechanics and feeding
                  functional morphology during the Mesozoic era, resulting in
                  the flat, rigid skulls in crocodylians and the bulbous and
                  beaked, flexible skulls of birds. Here we use new approaches
                  in imaging, 3D modeling, morphometrics, lever mechanics,
                  finite element modeling and phylogenetic comparative methods
                  of living and extinct reptiles to show how morphological and
                  functional changes in the palate, cranial joints and jaw
                  musculature occurred within the fossil record of these
                  lineages that were key features in acquisition of the modern
                  forms. We show how jaw muscles reoriented their resultants and
                  moments about jaw joints during skull flattening,
                  palatocranial suturing and feeding specializations in Jurassic
                  crocodyliforms. These morphological changes resulted in a
                  decrease in mechanical efficiency of the feeding apparatus
                  that was compensated for by an increase in jaw muscle sizes
                  and canalized muscle architecture. Meanwhile, along the line
                  to living birds, the acquisition of enlarged brains in
                  coelurosaur dinosaurs resulted in a shifting of temporal and
                  palatal muscle positions, a canalization of
                  vertically-oriented of muscle forces and consequently
                  reorientation of their moments about palatocranial joints.
                  These changes in loading environment, along with a concatenate
                  increase in the propulsive and bending properties of the
                  palate, facilitated cranial kinesis in neoavian birds.
                  Together, these examples of evolutionary innovation in reptile
                  cranial biomechanics reveal powerful new approaches to testing
                  biomechanical and evolutionary hypotheses in any cranial or
                  appendicular musculoskeletal system.},
